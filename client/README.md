# Dashboard Application

This application is designed to allow a user to view their budget items, calendar events, and reminders on a per-day basis.

Source Code: <https://github.com/johnrobertmcc/dashboard-web>

## Tech Stack

- All data is stored in MongoDB
- Data is accessed using React as a UI tool and Redux as a state management.
- Component library built by author @johnrobertmcc also used for sharing data between web and mobile applications.

## Planned Updates

Eventually I would like to implement Web3 authentication either as NFT or as a MetaMask extension. This would include the use of smart contracts to sign budget transactions.
